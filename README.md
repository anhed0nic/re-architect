## üöÄ Features

- **Binary Analysis**: Decompiles and analyzes binary files using state-of-the-art techniques
- **Function Summarization**: Generates concise, accurate summaries of function behaviors using LLM technology
- **Data Structure Recovery**: Identifies and reconstructs complex data structures from binaries
- **Test Harness Generation**: Creates runnable test harnesses for recovered functions with built-in safety constraints
- **Interactive Visualization**: Presents results through an intuitive user interface with configurable views
- **Multiple Decompiler Support**: Seamlessly integrates with Ghidra, IDA Pro, and Binary Ninja
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

RE-Architect consists of several integrated components working together to provide a comprehensive reverse engineering solution:

1. **Binary Loader**: Handles various binary formats (ELF, PE, Mach-O) and architectures (x86, ARM, MIPS)
2. **Decompiler Bridge**: Interfaces with leading decompilers using a uniform abstraction layer
3. **Analysis Engine**: Performs static, dynamic, and symbolic analysis to extract program behavior
4. **LLM Interpreter**: Uses AI to generate natural language explanations of code functionality
5. **Test Generator**: Creates safe, executable test harnesses with appropriate input generation
6. **Visualization Layer**: Provides interactive graphical representations of program structure and data flow

## üîß Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/re-architect.git
cd re-architect

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the analysis on a sample binary
python main.py --input samples/example.exe --output results/ --config config.yaml
```

For Docker users:
```bash
# Build and run using Docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose run re-architect --input /app/samples/example.exe --output /app/results/
```

## üß™ Example

```python
from re_architect import REPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline with configuration
pipeline = REPipeline("config.yaml")

# Analyze a binary
results = pipeline.analyze("path/to/binary")

# Generate function summaries
summaries = results.get_function_summaries()

# Generate test harnesses
tests = results.generate_test_harnesses()

# Export results
results.export("output_directory")
```

## üìä Performance

RE-Architect typically processes:

| Binary Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Small (<1MB) | 1-2 minutes | ~2GB |
| Medium (1-10MB) | 5-10 minutes | ~4GB |
| Large (>10MB) | 15+ minutes | 8GB+ |
